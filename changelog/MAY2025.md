# Update log - May 2025

## Introduction
This month, there are some updates that incorporate a new device: the Artus Lite+ with Contactile Force Sensors and a few streaming optimizations.

## Change List
* Added Artus Lite Plus to robot devices under [the Artus Lite folder](/ArtusAPI/robot/artus_lite/). To use the Lite+, when initializing the API, or using the yaml config files, change robot type from 'artus_lite' to 'artus_lite_plus'
* Added specific startup ack byte for better resynchronization of streaming when not sleeping the device between separate scripts. Still optimizing.
* Updated ArtusAPI pypi, which includes a flashing command line tool. Use `artusapiflash -h`.
* Separate streaming timing for Rx and Tx
* Testing force feedback from current data for Artus Lite. Still WIP. Use `feedback_current` data as normal.
* Update GUIv2 to work with Artus Lite Plus
* align github version and pypi version
